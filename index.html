        <p>I am Melanie Mok. Welcome to my portfolio. I am
          currently working toward becoming a full-stack software developer,
          and this is my first official self-developed web page. I am very
          passionate with coding. At one point, I did not realize that I was
          coding for thirteen hours straight, I was not even feeling tired, and that
          was the very beginning of my intoduction to Computer Sceince
          courses. </p>

        <p>Right now, I am looking forward to be creating my first
          fully functional game that I have had in my mind for years. I want
          to be able to make my very own game from scratch, taking care of
          both front-end and back-end of the entire game. I really wanted to
          create games, mainly because I think games can express my thoughts,
          my cultures and personality. It can also bring joy while being
          educational depend on the categories of the game. I look forward
          to everything that I will be learning in this class.</p>
